## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

According to our summary results, Vehicle Length and Ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. In other words, these two variables had a significant impact on miles per gallon. The R-Squared value of .71, showing a high correlation between our dependent and independent variables. Coupled with our p-value of -5e-11 being significantly lower than 0.5 -indicating strong statistical significance- we can safely assume the slope of our linear model is not zero. Given the high correlation and statistically significant p-value, we believe this linear model effectively predicts mpg of Mechacar Prototypes.
