![Linear Regression](https://github.com/rivas-j/Mechacar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/e5d0dcd6e7ef62b8463cc14e26fe059b667f40f3/Resources/deliverable1_linearregression.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
